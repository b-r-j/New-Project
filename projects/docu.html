    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.<p><ul><li> Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),</li><li> JavaScript can be connected</li> to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
  <section class="main-section" id="WHAT_YOU_SHOULD_ALREADY_KNOW">
    <header><h4>What you should already know</h4></header>
    <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
    <ul><li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
      <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
      <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming,</li><li> try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript</li>
    </ul></section>
  <section class="main-section" id="JAVASCRIPT_AND_JAVA">
    <header><h4>
      JavaScript and Java</h4></header>
    <ul><li>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.</li><li> The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.</li></ul><p> JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="variables">
    <header><h4>variables</h4></header>
    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
 <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
<p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
 <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
<p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p></section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
    <header id="#Variable_scope"><h4>Variable_scope</h4></header>
      <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p> <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code><p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p></section>
  <section class="main-section" id="GLOBAL_VARIABLE">
    <header><h4>Global_variable</header>
      </h4><p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p><p>

Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
      </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
      <header><h4>Constants</h4></header>
      <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier:</p> <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code><p> it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code></section>
    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
      <header><h4>while statement</h4></header><p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p><code>while (condition) statement</code></section></main>
